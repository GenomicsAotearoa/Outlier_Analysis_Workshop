# Example scripts for some of the main steps of the vignette

These scripts have been written for a SLURM workload manager. If your cluster system is PBS you will need to make some minor changes to the file header for them to work properly. You can find more information on the difference between SLURM and PBS [HERE](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), but the best place to consult will be your cluster provider's help page.
