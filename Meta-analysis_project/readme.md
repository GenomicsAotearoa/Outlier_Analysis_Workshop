# Compiling outlier results across species

This workshop will be designed to run as intro + 3 x 15 min case studies from researchers and students. Then two day workshop (free) and catered. 

People who have the correct type of data can optionally provide some data towards the project. If you run the data yourself and contribute to manuscript writing this would constitute authorship.

Why is compliling this information across species useful?
list!

No requirements for what type of outliers required. We are just interest in sites under recent change. This could be env. assoc change, pehno assoc change, or identified through plain outlier 9non assoc) means. These sites are likely under rapid adaptation. thus are interesting.
